Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Reddit, the list of ways to distract yourself with your phone are never ending!

Introducing Huddle, the app made to keep you off of those apps and on task with whatever goal your group is setting.

Maybe your team needs to key in for your daily stand up as you outline the goals for the day.

Or maybe you're in a study session over zoom getting ready for tomorrow's midterm.

Huddle is here to keep your group engaged and mindful of their time.

*Set a countdown in the app that only moves when everyone is in the app, away from all other distractions.
*Countdown stops when users try to multitask or put Huddle in the background, ensuring that distractions are kept to a minimum.
*Visual indicator of who's inside the team huddle and who's getting distracted by all the other stuff on their phone.
*Live chat lets users send messages inside a Huddle.
*Best of all, no sign up or account required!
